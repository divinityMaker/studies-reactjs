useCallback is a React hook that returns a memoized callback function. It is useful when you have a component that has a child component that needs to update or re-render when the parent component's props or state changes. By using useCallback, you can avoid unnecessary re-renders of the child component by ensuring that the callback function only changes if one of its dependencies has changed.

In this example, MyButton is a functional component that takes an onClick prop and passes it to a handleClick callback function. The handleClick function is created using useCallback, and the onClick prop is passed as a dependency. This means that the handleClick function will only be re-created if the onClick prop changes. This can help to avoid unnecessary re-renders of the MyButton component when the parent component re-renders.
