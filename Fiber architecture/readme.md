In this example, we wrap the JSX elements inside the functional component in a Suspense component. The Suspense component is a new feature in React that was introduced as part of the Fiber architecture. It allows you to "suspend" the rendering of a component until some condition is met (such as data being loaded from an API). While the component is suspended, the fallback prop is displayed.

In this case, we are using the Suspense component to show a loading indicator while the component is suspended. Once the component is ready to render, it will display the JSX elements inside the Suspense component.
