The Flux pattern is a design pattern that consists of a set of conventions for how data should flow through a React application. It is based on the idea of unidirectional data flow, which means that data flows in a single direction through the application, from the Store to the View (the React components that display the data). The Store holds the state for the application, and the Action is responsible for dispatching actions that update the state of the Store.
